Module Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures

Advanced algorithms and data structures are the backbone of solving complex computational problems efficiently. They go beyond the basics (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues) and introduce specialized techniques for optimization, scalability, and handling large or complex datasets.
